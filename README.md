# 📊 Erica Tennyson | Power BI Portfolio

## About Me
I am a bilingual (English–Japanese) data and communication professional with over ten years of experience in digital marketing analytics, reporting automation, and cross-cultural content evaluation.

My background spans business intelligence, campaign performance analysis, and multilingual reporting for global clients in Japan and the U.S. I create data-driven insights and visualizations using Power BI, Excel, and GA4 to support strategic decision-making and process improvement.

I am now expanding my portfolio into HR and workforce analytics, focusing on data-driven dashboards that support evidence-based decision-making in both public and private organizations.

My goal is to apply analytics to enhance organizational effectiveness, transparency, and long-term performance.
